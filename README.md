The idea behind this bot was to workaround a Plone bug. The bug didn't let editors edit certain portlets.

The plan was to have users edit a page instead. A trigger on the Plone site would email me the edit. The bot would read the email and make the changes.

A better workaround was found, so this bot was abandoned.
