The idea behind this bot was to workaround a Plone bug. The bug didn't let editors edit certain portlets.

Since users could not edit the portlets, they would edit a specific page instead. A trigger on the page would email the new content. The bot would read the email and make the changes.

A better workaround was found, so this bot was decommissioned.
